		Filled in CplInstrInfo.td the instructions that make up the set of instructions and added their specific patterns to CplPatterns.td.

		I've added the registers according to the calling convention.

		Add to SP, Ammount to know how much space to allocate on the stack and then copy the value from the source register to the destination register.

		For indirect function calls, I save the PC in LR, and then I deposit the result of the OR operation in the PC registry. For the return of an LR
		transfer function in PC using the OR operation. I also added to the CplRegisterInfo class the getPcRegister function that returns the R15 register.
