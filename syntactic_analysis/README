	Syntactic analysis

		The code performs the syntactic and lexical analysis for the LCPL language, after this analysis results in an AST.

		The lexical analysis is carried out in the file "lcpl.l" in which we added new token definitions as well as a new
		regular expression for the strings that the syntactic analyzer receives as input.

		The syntactic analysis describes the syntactic structure of the LCPL language, receiving as input the tokens of the
		lexical analyzer that will result in nodes in the AST. Each rule from the syntactic analysis depending on the case
		takes the tokens from the lexical analyzer and performs the syntactic analysis. This is also where the grammar
		associated with the LCPL language was written. We added new non-terminals to create precedent for operations like this:
			1 -> ., [method], string, {}, if, while;
			2 -> "- Unary";
			3 -> "*", "/";
			4 -> "+", "-";
			5 -> "<", "<=", "==";
			6 -> NEW operator, "!" and "SELF".

	The difficulties encountered were for the KW_LOCAL token because it correctly parsed a structure that contained several
	statements but did not add my line_number, that is, it gave me the line number of the first statement in the KW_LOCAL block.
